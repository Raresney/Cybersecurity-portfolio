# Cybersecurity-portofolio
This is my cybersecurity portfolio. Here I collect notes, labs, and practical exercises from the Google Cybersecurity Certificate and my hands-on practice (TryHackMe and other labs). I update it as I learn and improve.

## Professional statement
I am a cybersecurity learner focused on developing practical skills in threat detection, incident response, and security monitoring. I enjoy analyzing security alerts, investigating real attack scenarios, and understanding how systems can be protected against modern threats. I'm actively building hands-on experience through the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate, TryHackMe SOC Level 1 labs, and defensive security projects. I am working toward a SOC Analyst role where I can contribute to protecting systems, responding to security incidents, and continuously improving security posture.
